Before Artsy, I taught iOS at a summer school [in Princeton](http://orta.io/on/being/25/). I'm no ivy league-r, but the environment was perfect for experimenting with different methods of learning. One concept that stuck well was using games to teach language syntax.

I polished this idea till [WibbleQuest](http://orta.io/WibbleQuest/) was created. I pored many late nights, and fresh minds into the creation of a framework for building interactive fiction on iOS. It helped roughly a hundred odd kids get started in iOS. Now it's helping me get into Swift.

I've been watching Artsy's [Eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon) as we build out the foundations of an app in Swift and wondered what would happen when I start contributing. So this weekend under the guise of [ludum dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) I've been re-writing it in Swift.

For reference, [WibbleQuest](http://orta.io/WibbleQuest/) was created in a time where you couldn't use blocks ( only iOS4 supported it, and it had just come out ), NSArray & NSDictionary literals didn't exist and CocoaPods hadn't been created yet.

I started by building an application. I then started building a library. I deleted the application, and replaced it with a playground. Playground driven developlement is very similar to how I build things in ruby. Spend some time in the REPL then copy & paste it out. It's been nice.

One thing that I have found the hardest is the same thing I found hard when I made WibbleQuest. Writing a story is hard. By orders of magnitude in comparision to this blog post. Writing a game framework is easier than writing a game.

Should I be writing a game?
Should it be a story?
