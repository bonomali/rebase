In honour of "cocoapods":https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods, which I've been experimenting with lately I figured it was time to update an old bash script I was using multiple times daily. It started off extremely simple as an alias.


{% highlight js %}
alias openx="open *.xcodep*"
{% endhighlight %}


And ended up turning into a script that checks for whether there are any xcworkspaces, and if so loading the first of them only. Failing that it looks for an xcode project. As this is in general the order you should be opening them. It's useful to me. Could be for you.


{% highlight bash %}
  openx(){ 
    if test -n "$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.xcworkspace' -print -quit)"
    then
      echo "Opening workspace"
      open *.xcworkspace
      return
    else
      if test -n "$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.xcodeproj' -print -quit)"
      then
        echo "Opening project"
        open *.xcodeproj
        return  
      else
        echo "Nothing found"
      fi
    fi
  }
{% endhighlight %}
