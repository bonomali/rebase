It feels right to come back to `rebase` to discuss the idea of time.

Everyone gets allocated 24 hours in a day, and as adults it's up to us to figure out what to do with it. I've spent two years away from this blog. In it's place I've created so much, including another blog. I've done pretty well with the CocoaPods blog, and seem to have found my voice on twitter.

Enough exposition, let's explore. I get asked this a lot.

Well the simple answer is: I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. The expanded answer is I have a few advantages over a lot of people with respect to time. 

I have an awesome but [long-distance girlfriend](http://orta.github.io/rebase/on/skype/) who I see once every month or two. She's not time demanding. My family live thousands of miles away, my local friends are also [all](http://vesperapp.co) [busy](https://yourkarma.com) [building](http://www.tumblr.com/) [amazing](http://meetup.com) [things](http://artsy.net). The people I interact with online are mostly in a similar level of focus. 

I work for [a company](http://artsy.net) with a firm belief in being a strong contributor to the community you rely on. There was never a specific talk about my CocoaPods time, it happened naturally. I was actively encouraged to talk publicly as much as I wanted. 

I wish more people had the amount of time I have to devote to building tools and products. 

The more time you spend on these things the easier it becomes to build the next one. I sometimes think that [Mattt](http://mattt.me) is in the same place, just a bit further down the line. His output is phenomenal, reminding me of [_why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff) / [tenderlove](http://tenderlovemaking.com/) / [Konstantin Haase](http://rkh.im/). I'd love to know how they manage their time. Someone should make [the setup](http://usesthis.com/) for timekeeping
