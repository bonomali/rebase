Today I was moved by [Drip, Drop, Groundswell](http://blog.colepeters.com/drip-drop-groundswell/) from [Cole Peters](http://blog.colepeters.com/),  on his you should read it.

In Britain we have a problem with Data Retention, and perhaps more [sadly with Democracy](https://www.google.co.uk/search?as_q=drip&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=www.theguardian.com&as_occt=any&safe=images&tbs=&as_filetype=&as_rights=). Last week our government rushed through some pretty disgusting legislation in order to avoid a law-suit. Go [read the papers](https://www.google.co.uk/search?as_q=drip&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=www.theguardian.com&as_occt=any&safe=images&tbs=&as_filetype=&as_rights=) about it if you want to know all the information, no need for my paraphrasing.

I've slowly become politicised since the Snowdown leaks. I remember saw the data that the governments were slurping up on mobiles I put my head in my hands and cried. I am still responsible for making it easier to create new iOS apps, for doing everything I can to lower that barrier to entry. I don't have the answer for whether my work makes the world a worse place for this.

Seriously, read [Drip, Drop, Groundswell](http://blog.colepeters.com/drip-drop-groundswell/).
