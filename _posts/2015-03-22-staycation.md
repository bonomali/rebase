I live in NYC. I grew up in the north of England. Four years ago I started seeing this lovely lady.

Last year to balance the distance I agreed to speak at a lot of [conferences][1], this year she came over to NYC for two weeks. I spent a bunch of time asking people what we should do. So I took a two week vacation from Artsy & CocoaPods. 

We started out with a huge list of things to do, and would pick a thing or two from the list each morning. Unless it required pre-booking, wherein I had usually already sorted that.

I’ve taken the liberty of making a [Yelp page][2] of all the restraunts incase you want to look at those specifically. I am normally vegetarian, but given that Danger was over, I opted to go full omnivore in order to share more food with her.

| Day | Things |
| --- | ------ |  
| 1 | We started the tour by going straight to the Statue of Liberty. We walked down to the southern tip of Manhattan and followed the crowd to a ship. It was nice, if a tad underwhelming like all tourist architecture tends to be. We got out and went straight to [bare burger][3], a renound burger bar in the finance district. They were expensive burgers, and it was cool to get recognised in manhattan in front of my girlfriend :) - we finished the evening with an Artsy happy hour. |

| 2 | Previous to Danger arriving I had been volunteering with the Coalition for Queens. They were hosting an event, so we went along to that in the morning. This was fun. We hung out a bit at home, and tried to make it to the [NYC Porn Film Festival][4] but couldn’t buy tickets on the door. So we headed back and did [Kellogg's diner][5] for some Americana.

| 3 | For breakfast we went to [Yonah Schimmel’s Knishery][6] - this is a few steps from my house. Lovely place, really old school. I had never heard of a knish, they’re nice, [stodgy][7] potato buns. In the evening we went to the [Discovery Museum][8] and attended their Bodyworks exhibition and be kinda creeped out by the human body. As it was a sunday, we participated in my sunday dinner club. We ate [vegan junk food][9] at Champs, in Brooklyn.

| 4 | We got up and did bagels at [Russ and daughters][10]. Bagels are a thing in NYC, and this place is famous. A bagel there comes to around $15 ( for contrast, I get them for 6 for $8 at a store. ) It turns out the traditional way to do it is cold. We heat them and add cream cheese and marmite. It’s the real way to eat them IMO.

Anyway we went to the [Rockerfella Center’s][11] Top of the Rock instead of the Empire States building. It looked like the view of Central Park would be cooler. It was a beautiful view.

We went back did dinner with Dave Wiskus at a cool [Italian place][12]. |

| 5 | We figured now that we had seen Central Park from afar, and that the weather had a snowy forecast it was the day to go to Central Park. We look a look around  The five guys burger, central park, meatball shop
