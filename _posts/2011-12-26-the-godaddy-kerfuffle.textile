I think its great to see the current push away from godaddy in response to their active support in SOPA. I wonder if this is a case of people are slowly becoming more and more political in expressing their opinions both online and off. I think the only domain I have left with godaddy is brutaltechnopunk.com and that'll probably have to go too.

for anything technical I've been using simpleDNS. Everyone knew godaddy was a bad apple a long time ago. It's crazy that they got themselves excempt from SOPA also, people aren't focussing too much.
