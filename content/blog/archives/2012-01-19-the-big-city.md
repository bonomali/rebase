I’ve never lived in a city as large as New York before I got there, I
wonder how many bigger cites there are in the world. [Turns out
there’s 32](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=cities%20ranked%20by%20population).
I’ve lived in Rio de Janeiro, Hull and Huddersfield, substantially
smaller places. And they all have a different place in my heart. If I
had to say I had a hometown it would be Huddersfield, and all my friends
from Hull are now long-gone. Rio feels like a girlfriend I never got to
say goodbye to properly but wave at on the steet when I see her.

but I’m still not sure what I feel about New York.

What I do know is that I loved the culture of the city, the little
surprises around every corner, the beautiful pizza shops and the amazing
bars. It was amazing to be given Art Gallery tours by [Julia
Colavita](http://juliacolavita.com/), [Maia
Peck](https://twitter.com/#!/MaiaPeck) and [Ibiayi
Briggs](https://twitter.com/#!/ibiayi) who would answer every stupid art
question I had. It was and still is a great experience working with
[Art.sy](http://art.sy) and being dragged around by [Benjamin
Jackonson](http://90wpm.com). Hopefully I’ll get to go back out in a few
months time and do some more rocking out in my onesie. Till then I’m
going to figure out what I think.
