I love this part of System Preferences on the Mac, I can't stress enough how useful it is to be able to remap commands 
in the menu to make apps act how you'd expect. Take Safari for example, I use the name of my bookmarklets that are in 
the bookmarklets bar and I can just use those to make far more logical keyboard shrotcuts for me. At some point I'll 
polish up my Xcode keyboard shortcuts that make it more text-mate like. Just a friendly reminder to use this amazing 
feature.
