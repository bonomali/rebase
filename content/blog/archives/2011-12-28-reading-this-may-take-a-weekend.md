[Less Wrong on How You Can Help Save The World](http://lesswrong.com/lw/91c/so_you_want_to_save_the_world/)

The Less wrong blog is essential a prettier interface to the [Less Wrong wiki](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/LessWrong_Wiki), which in itself is probably the most intelligent community on the internet in my opinion. The name is pretty obvious, and the concept revolves around rationalism and futurism. One of the current trends is thinking about an AI singularity ( basically self-awareness in AI. )

It would be interesting to have a nice way to read some of these posts, there's a huge amount of subreading in order to just understand one article, as they're all backed up by scientific papers that are long, but interesting and on point. As right now I don't really make the time for such huge amounts of reading, maybe once [Mixtapes](http://github.com/orta/mixtapes) is out I can try reading up on Less Wrong as a project.
