I use an Apple Magic mouse, I bought it the day it came out because I was feeling the strain of actively lifting my wrists up to reach over the last mouse, the magic mouse has a low profile, I like it. I don't like using it though.

So it's really satisfying when I see the message popup on my screen that I've not used my mouse in ages and it's turned itself off. So these are the tools I use to avoid ever using a mouse, as well as a bunch of keyboard shortcuts for everyday tasks.
